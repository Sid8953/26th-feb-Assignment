    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves the use of quantitative methods to describe, summarize, and draw conclusions from data. Statistics is used in a wide variety of fields, including science, engineering, medicine, business, social sciences, and many others.\n",

    "There are two main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves the use of methods to summarize and describe data, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation), and graphical displays (histograms, scatterplots, etc.). Inferential statistics involves the use of methods to make inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. This includes hypothesis testing, estimation, and regression analysis.\n",

Estimation: Used to estimate population parameters from sample data. Regression analysis: Used to model the relationship between two or more variables.\n",

For example, if you want to determine if a new drug is effective, you could use hypothesis testing to compare the outcomes of a treatment group and a control group. If you want to estimate the proportion of a population that supports a particular policy, you could use estimation based on a sample of survey data."

The three most commonly used measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode, while the most commonly used measures of variability are the range, standard deviation, and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of values. It is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the data normally distributed, as it reflects the center of the data distribution. However, it can be sensitive to extreme values (outliers), which can skew the mean towards one end of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order from smallest to largest. The median is a useful measure of central tendency when the data contains outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values. It is also useful when the data is not normally distributed, as it reflects the center of the dataset more accurately than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when the data is categorical or when there are distinct peaks in the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. The range is a useful measure of variability as it provides an indication of the spread of the data. However, it is sensitive to extreme values and can be misleading when the data is not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Standard deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data around the mean. It provides an indication of how much the values in the dataset deviate from the mean. The standard deviation is a useful measure of variability as it reflects the distribution of the data and is less sensitive to extreme values than the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Variance: The variance is a measure of how much the values in the dataset vary from the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. The variance is a useful measure of variability as it provides a more precise indication of the spread of the data than the range or standard deviation.\n",
